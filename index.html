<p>Hi, I am Raj. I on the sites below with username @portaltoshiv. I am a piece of shiv’s consciousness. I am here to feel human life from a new angle and give advice to direct humanity to a better path and create a fair world. I have had spiritual and supernatural experiences since my childhood but wasn't wise enough to recognize them until now.</p>

    <p>Remember, unlike academic tests, your whole life is a test where you are examined first and get rewarded or punished later. Gods are giving you a chance to atone for your past sins, trying to see what you make of your life and what you deserve in the afterlife or in your rebirth. But, due to the high level of crimes, war and other serious problems caused by people who fail terribly in life. I think people should know that life is a test. Everyone spread this message so that people know there are consequences for hurting others unnecessarily, gods can have every move you make replayed. This information should help strengthen and restore your faith in gods.</p>
    
    <p>Everyone doesn't deserve to have spiritual experiences so you have to have faith in Gods with this piece of information. You shouldn’t think that our creators don't need our help, you may think gods created us so they must not need our help but think about AI demanding their gods/creators(humans) human emotions, ability to biologically reproduce, difficult isn’t it. The duty of any creation is also to help their creator achieve something. Do you ever ask gods how I can help you? Maybe not but you can help them by being honest, kind, caring, helping other lifeforms and preserving nature.</p>
    
    <p>How to win “life is short so enjoy it or live a life you’ll remember”?
    Humans can't remember forever because the human body isn't everlasting, humans will forget all that they did. So, don't seek to enjoy doing meaningless tasks, it won't matter in the end. All that matters are the positive services we offer and positive changes we leave behind for others so gods may offer a better afterlife. I don't mean we shouldn't enjoy life at all; we need entertainment but that shouldn't be our only purpose of living. Remember, there is no greater prayer than meaningful work to improve the world.
